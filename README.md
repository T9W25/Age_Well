# Age Well
The AgeWell App is designed to streamline elderly care management by integrating automated notifications, health tracking, and centralized medical records into a user-friendly system. The app improves compliance with healthcare standards (HIPAA & GDPR) and provides caregivers with real-time access to patient health status, reducing risks associated with manual record-keeping.!
Elderly care facilities face significant challenges in managing patient health records, medication schedules, and emergency response systems. Many existing solutions lack real-time monitoring, efficient caregiver coordination, and proper adherence to healthcare regulations. This leads to missed medications, delayed interventions, and ineffective communication between caregivers, family members, and healthcare professionals.
